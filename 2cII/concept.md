- an object which places you in time 
the idea i have is a lamp, its xyz coordinates controll the effects in the cpp system
its a timestretcher, which when you place the lamp back from the audience slows down the music
also when the lamp is further away so will the reverb be 
and the low pass filter will allow less high frequencies when the lamp is further away
this is for a live show in which the light guides you to somewhere, and when the lamp is far away it allows for a monologue vibe to appear
possible use: theater

* ladder filter
* grain delay (as stretcher) MAYBE with a pitch shifter 
* datorro reverb
