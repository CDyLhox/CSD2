    =====   what the "whatthedogSEQUENCER"  ======
    WHATTHEDOGSequencer is a sequencer for drums using euclidean rhythm generation. to recreate a jazz drum feel 

    =====   What stage of development are we in now?    =====
    well, the whatthedogSEQUENCER was originally built to be a python learning module using simpleaudio. and for the time being will stay that way.
    we are planning to maybe make this a better integrated system in the future for better personal use, here is some stuff you may be able to look forward to
        -better rhythm flow 
        -integrating multi pulse systems so the snare can have a different feel as the kick 
        -visualing the eucliCircles 
        -integrating swing percentages
